##About the Data

I deeply enjoy anime, and would like to work with anime data. A few things I am interested in would include data correlation between rating and upvotes, in more detail, whether an anime has to be objectively good in order to be like. Maybe also how the upvotes relate to the genre as well. What genres are more popular, and so on.
